# Popup Chinese Mobile Application

A Vue.js Application for learning the Chinese Language

# Introduction

I am a great fan of popupchinese.com, an online website with tons of podcasts to improve your chinese listening skill.
Unfortunately their website isn't responsive, so I have build this mobile application. 

# Installation

To run the application on your machine:

1. Make sure you have latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

2. Download repository and run

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run application.

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
